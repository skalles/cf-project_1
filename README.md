## Overview

The Integrated Chat Room is trying to solve the problem that people need to log in to different social network websites in order to chat with their friends within a certain social scope.

### Hypotheses
 - Users like chatting and are chatty.
 - Users do not need to go to a specific website to chat.
 - In certain scenarios, the main objective of logging into a social network website is to verbally communicate with other users.

#### User Research

- The existence and popularity of chat applications prove the first hypothesis.
- There is a overlap of users among different chat resources.
- There are over 400 million users on line, 200 millions on facebook messenger, and 300 million users on skype.

#### MVP

- The ability to let users log into their account.
- At least three different channels.
- A window for each channel.
- The ability to switch channels.
